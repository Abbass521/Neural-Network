# Neural-Network
Neural networks have become a powerful tool in various fields, ranging from pattern recognition to machine learning. The nnstart toolbox in MATLAB offers a GUI-based approach for creating and training neural networks. In this lab, we aim to harness the capabilities of nnstart for two specific tasks: curve fitting and classification.
## nnstart
”nnstart” in MATLAB’s Neural Network Toolbox serves as a convenient entry point by opening a window with launch buttons for various neural network applications, including the Neural Net Fitting app, Neural Net Pattern Recognition app, Neural Net Clustering app, and Neural Net Time Series app. This graphical user interface simplifies the process of creating, configuring, and training neural networks by providing easy access to different applications tailored for specific tasks. Additionally, ”nnstart” offers links to datasets, examples, and other resources, offering users valuable information and guidance for efficiently starting and progressing with neural network projects.
## Neural Net Fitting App
The Neural Net Fitting app is a versatile tool that facilitates the creation, visualization, and training of a two-layer feed-forward neural network designed to address data fitting challenges. Users can effortlessly import data from various sources, including files and the MATLAB workspace, or utilize provided example datasets. The app enables the division of data into training, validation, and test sets, empowering users to define and train a neural network. Performance evaluation is streamlined through metrics like mean squared error and regression analysis, with results comprehensively analyzed through visualization plots such as regression fit or histograms of errors. Ad- ditionally, the app allows for the generation of MATLAB scripts to replicate results and customize the training process. For practical deployment, the app supports the creation of functions compatible with MATLAB CompilerTM and MATLAB CoderTM tools, and it enables export to Simulink® for integration with Simulink Coder.
