# Neural-Network
Neural networks have become a powerful tool in various fields, ranging from pattern recognition to machine learning. The nnstart toolbox in MATLAB offers a GUI-based approach for creating and training neural networks. In this lab, we aim to harness the capabilities of nnstart for two specific tasks: curve fitting and classification.
